Summary:

The "Attention is All You Need" paper introduces the Transformer architecture, 
revolutionizing how machines process language. Think of attention like a spotlight 
in a dark room - instead of looking at everything equally, the model learns to 
focus on the most important parts of a sentence when understanding context...

Mathematical Details:
The core attention mechanism uses the formula: Attention(Q,K,V) = softmax(QK^T/√d_k)V
This calculates how much focus to put on each word when processing another word...
🔧 Customization
*Adding New Papers*
Modify the paper_input selectbox in prompt.py:
pythonpaper_input = st.selectbox("select research paper Name", [
    "Attention is All you need",
    "Your New Paper Title",
    # Add more papers here

*Modifying Explanation Styles*
Update the select_type options:
pythonselect_type = st.selectbox("Select Explanation you want:", [
    'Beginer-Friendly',
    'Your Custom Style',
    # Add more styles

*Customizing Prompts*
Edit templates.py to modify the prompt template, then regenerate:
bashpython templates.py
